The groupingDataGenerator file outputs data files for clustering analysis. 
To Run, simply compile then execute, afterwhich prompts will guide you in 
the creation of data set. The output is a collection of files, one per scaleFactor, 
with the naming convention of 
outputFileName_SF_ScaleFactorNumber_DIM_nimDim_EPS_epsilon_PPSF_numberOfPointsPerSF_Min_minPoints_Max_maxPoints

The rows of each record are randomized data for each nth dimension, whereas 
each column is a diffrent dimension. 
The first two values of a record are the recordID Number and the group they belong to.
